# My Neovim Configs

This Neovim configuration is written mostly in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It uses an absurd amount of plugins (~50 when written), but the load time is quick enough for my daily use. The configs might change week-to-week as I'm testing out new plugins or trying to optimize the existing configuration settings...

## TODO

LSPs to add:

- LaTex: can use [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab).

Some plugins to try:

- Ranger integration: [Rnvimr](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/rnvimr). Use ranger in a floating buffer instead of as a tiled buffer.
- Using GBrowse with fugitive: [rhubarb.vim](https://github.com/tpope/rhubarb.vim).
- Jupyter on Neovim:
  - [jupytext.vim](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext),
  - [iron.nvim](https://github.com/hkupty/iron.nvim),
  - [vim-textobj-hydrogen](https://github.com/GCBallesteros/vim-textobj-hydrogen). Check this [blog](https://www.maxwellrules.com/misc/nvim_jupyter.html) for more info.
- Git diff and refactoring in Neovim: [diffview.nvim](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim)
- Structural search and replace: [ssr.nvim](https://github.com/cshuaimin/ssr.nvim). ssr.nvim parses your search pattern to syntax trees to perform structural searching.
- Structural search and replace: [ssr.nvim](https://github.com/cshuaimin/ssr.nvim). ssr.nvim parses your search pattern to syntax trees to perform structural searching.
