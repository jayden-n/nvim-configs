# My Neovim Configs

This Neovim configuration is written mostly in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It uses an absurd amount of plugins (~50 when written), but the load time is quick enough for my daily use. The configs might change week-to-week as I'm testing out new plugins or trying to optimize the existing configuration settings...
